<P>Some of my <I>favorite</I> things to do include hiking, watching TV, and 
working out. After a long day of school, however, I’ll usually cool
down and take a nap. I <I>love</I> playing flute in the wind ensemble at Oak
Ridge and going to marching practice every week, but the best part of band 
are the <B>football games</B> because there is so much hype and we can 
really get into the school spirit.</P>
<P>My favorite places to eat or hang out with friends are In n Out, Juice
it Up and the Nugget.</P>
